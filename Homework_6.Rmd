Homework #6, Stat 660, Spring 2024, Due February 13

1. Fit a multiple linear regression of LSBP (Y) on Lcholest and smoker using mgcv::gam.
Since the smoking variable is binary, this is an ordinary ANCOVA without an interaction.
You will notice that the Rsquared is quite low. Produce a table of estimates, standard errors
and p-values.

```{r lin regres}
# clear workspace
rm(list = ls())
# set the seed
set.seed(382957)
library(HRW)
library(mgcv)

# import data
init = read.csv("~/660 - Flexible Regression/Homework/Homework6/Framingham.csv")
SBP      = rowMeans(init[, c(3:6)])
LSBP     = log(SBP - 50)
cholest  = rowMeans(init[, c(8:9)])
Lcholest = log(cholest)
data     = cbind(init[, c("CHD", "Age", "Smoker")], LSBP, Lcholest)

# Fit a multiple linear gam to the data
lm_LSBP = gam(LSBP ~ Lcholest + factor(Smoker), data = data)
summary(lm_LSBP)
```
2. Just for fun (not graded but required) Do a little bit of a web search about whether
smokers have higher or lower blood pressure than nonsmokers. Does the analysis in (1)
agree? Just give a coherent answer.

> I found the general results to be that smokers have lower blood pressure than nonsmokers. This is consistent with the analysis in (1) since the estimate for "Smoker" is negative.

3. Just for fun (not graded but required) In Question 1, there is a subtle statistical
interpretation of what I am asking you to do, because your analysis also includes the
transformed cholesterol variable. I am curious if you can produce the correct terminology
for what that subtle interpretation is. Please, less than 15 words. This is a test of your
background, but I want to make sure you know how to report results appropriately.

> We interpret log transformations as percentages.

4. Do the same thing as in Question 1 but add an interaction between Lcholest and smoker.

```{r interaction}
# Fit a multiple linear gam to the data with interaction
lm_interact = gam(LSBP ~ Lcholest + factor(Smoker) + Lcholest*factor(Smoker), data = data)
summary(lm_interact)
```
5. Now run a semiparametric regression using mgcv, one that is the semiparametric version
of ANCOVA without an interaction.

```{r semiparametric ANCOVA}
# Fit a semiparametric multiple linear gam to the data
gam_LSBP = gam(LSBP ~ s(Lcholest, bs="cr", k=20) + factor(Smoker), method = "REML", data = data)
summary(gam_LSBP)
```

6. In Question 5, display a plot of the two lines, but without the data.

```{r same plot, opts.label = "figure1", fig.align="center"}
# Non-Smoker
ng = 1615
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_LSBP, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = xaxis,
  Smoker = rep(0,ng)))
plot(xaxis, yaxis, type = "n", 
     main = "Log Cholesterol and Log BP by Smoking Status",
     xlab = "Lcholest", 
     ylab = "LSBP", ylim = c(4, 5))
lines(xaxis,yaxis, col='red', lwd=2)

# Smoker
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_LSBP, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = xaxis,
  Smoker = rep(1,ng)))
lines(xaxis,yaxis, col='blue', lwd=2)

legend("topright", legend = c("Nonsmoker", "Smoker"), 
       col=c("red", "blue"),lty=1, cex=0.8)
```

7. In Question 5, display a plot of the two lines but in one graph with 2 columns”:
par(mfrow(1,2) does this, I believe, and also show their pointwise 95% confidence
intervals.

```{r two plots, fig.align="center"}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
ord = sort(data$Lcholest, index.return = T)$ix

# Non-Smoker
ng = 1615
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_LSBP, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = Lcholest,
  Smoker = rep(0,ng)), se = T)
plot(data$Lcholest, data$LSBP, type = "n", 
     main = "Nonsmoker log(Cholesterol vs. BP)",
     cex.main=0.8,
     xlab = "Lcholest", 
     ylab = "LSBP", ylim = c(4, 5))
upper = yaxis$fit + (1.96 * yaxis$se.fit)
lower = yaxis$fit - (1.96 * yaxis$se.fit)
polygon(x=c(Lcholest, rev(Lcholest)), y=c(upper, rev(lower)),
        col="gray", border=NA)
lines(Lcholest, yaxis$fit, col='red', lwd=2)

# Smoker
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_LSBP, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = xaxis,
  Smoker = rep(1,ng)), se = T)
plot(data$Lcholest, data$LSBP, type = "n", 
     main = "Smoker log(Cholesterol vs. BP)",
     cex.main=0.8,
     xlab = "Lcholest", 
     ylab = "LSBP", ylim = c(4, 5))
upper = yaxis$fit + (1.96 * yaxis$se.fit)
lower = yaxis$fit - (1.96 * yaxis$se.fit)
polygon(x=c(xaxis, rev(xaxis)), y=c(upper, rev(lower)),
        col="gray", border=NA)
lines(xaxis[ord], yaxis$fit[ord], col='blue', lwd=2)
  
```
8. Run the semiparametric version of ANCOVA but with an interaction. Does it look like
there is an interaction? Cite p-values and estimates

```{r semipar with interact}
# Fit a semiparametric multiple linear gam to the data with an interaction
gam_interact = gam(LSBP ~ s(Lcholest, bs="cr", k=20, by = Smoker) + factor(Smoker), 
               method = "REML", data = data)
summary(gam_interact)
```
> The interaction is significant at the 0.05 level, with a p-value of 2.32x10^-05.

9. In Question 8, display the fits but without the data points. 

```{r same plot interact, opts.label = "figure1", fig.align="center"}
# Non-Smoker
ng = 1615
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_interact, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = xaxis,
  Smoker = rep(0,ng)))
plot(xaxis, yaxis, type = "n", 
     main = "Log Cholesterol and Log BP by Smoking Status w/ Interaction",
     cex.main=0.9,
     xlab = "Lcholest", 
     ylab = "LSBP", ylim = c(4, 5))
lines(xaxis,yaxis, col='red', lwd=2)

# Smoker
xaxis = seq(min(Lcholest),max(Lcholest),length = ng)
yaxis = predict(gam_interact, newdata = data.frame(
  Lcholest = xaxis,
  Smoker = rep(1,ng)))
lines(xaxis,yaxis, col='blue', lwd=2)

legend("topright", legend = c("Nonsmoker", "Smoker"), 
       col=c("red", "blue"),lty=1, cex=0.8)
```
10. What does having an interaction mean in the case when the factors are binary?

> There exists a relationship when the factor is one value vs the other value; i.e. the outcome depends on one factor value vs the other.

11. Now run an analysis of whether the two lines (smoker versus nonsmoker) are statistically
significantly different when there is no interaction. You might remember that we contrasted
the Srod district with the other Warsaw districts at one point. This can be your guide.
Luckily, here smoker is a binary variable, so the reference population is the nonsmokers.

```{r no interaction}
# anova of no interaction model
anova(gam_LSBP)
```
> The p-value for Smoker with no interaction is 0.00244, which is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
